# words-calculate
E.g. find suitable compound words

This program will find all the compound words in a long list of words, by
taking the lexicon of all half-as-many-letters words and checking them against 
the long list.

## To-do

* ~~Somehow exclude place names, proper names from eight-letter list.~~
* Somehow classify each eight-letter word as true compound word, or whatever the other things are called.
* Make list of four-letter-word pairs that put together, don't make a word.
* remove contractions etc. from all lists
